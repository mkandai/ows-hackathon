# Server application guide


### Get Started

- First you need to clone "OpenWebSearch Prototype Search Application" repository from [here](https://opencode.it4i.eu/openwebsearcheu-public/prototype-search-application) and then replace "src" directory inside "search-service" of the prototype with "src" directory of our repository and then follow prototype's README.md instructions to run the server.
- Instead of using prototype's frontend, use our client.
- Instructions related to running our client application can be found at client directory of this repository.
